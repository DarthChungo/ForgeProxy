# ModProxy

A simple minecraft mod for allowing 1.12+ modded servers, like forge or fabric, to connect to proxy networks.

Minecraft proxy software, like bungeecord and velocity, do not support proxying modern modded clients when server-side mods are in play.
This project attempts to circumvent this restriction by bypassing the proxy completely for modded servers.
It instead, once installed on both client and server, sends a custom packet to clients with all the information necessary for them to make the connection themselves.
Once the client leaves the other server, it will reconnect back to the proxy server.
For this to work, both client and proxy must have this mod installed.
This shouldn't really cause problems with servers running server-side mods, as those already require clients to install the server's modpack locally.

This project targets proxying situations only, i.e., when wanting to connect a modded server to an existing network.
This way, it only requires a plugin to be installed on the proxy server running the network, and on clients that whish to connect to the server in question.
